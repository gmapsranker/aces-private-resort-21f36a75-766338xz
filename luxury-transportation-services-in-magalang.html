                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">We booked Aces Private Resort for my dad’s 60th birthday last March, and honestly, the whole experience was pretty smooth. The van that picked us up from Manila was spacious and super clean (my mum kept commenting on how comfy the seats were). The driver, Kuya Al, was patient even when we made a Starbucks stop along the way, and my nieces loved the mini fridge with cold drinks. Only downside was our pickup ran about 20 minutes late, but they kept us posted and apologized, which I appreciated. Overall, the transportation made our trip way more relaxing.</div>
                    <div class="testimonial-author">– Joanna L., Quezon City</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">I used Aces Private Resort’s luxury van service last December to shuttle my in-laws from Clark to Magalang. Booking was straightforward – Ms. Bea explained the options and even let us play our own Spotify playlist on the ride! The vehicle was top-notch – leather seats, charging ports, quiet AC. My in-laws are older and my father-in-law has trouble with steps, but the staff brought out a small step stool for him which was thoughtful. Minor issue: the driver got the address mixed up at first and we lost about 10 minutes, but he was polite and fixed it right away. Would definitely use again for big family events.</div>
                    <div class="testimonial-author">– Maria Singh, Angeles City</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">The luxury transportation getting to Aces Private Resort was good, but not perfect – van was spotless and cool, but Wi-Fi was spotty in some areas, which was a bit annoying since I needed to answer work emails. On the plus side, they had bottled water and snacks ready, and the driver actually knew some good shortcuts so we didn’t get stuck in Pampanga traffic. It was a solid experience, just wish the Wi-Fi was more reliable. Would recommend for groups, especially if you want a hassle-free trip from Manila.</div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">We recommend booking your luxury transportation at least 48 hours in advance, especially during weekends and holiday periods when demand is higher in Magalang and Pampanga. To book, simply let us know your pick-up and drop-off details when reserving your stay, or contact our concierge directly. We will confirm your booking via email or phone, and provide your driver’s details the day before your scheduled pick-up.</div>
