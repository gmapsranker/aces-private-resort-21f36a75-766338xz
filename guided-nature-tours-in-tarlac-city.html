                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">I visited Aces Private Resort last February with my husband and our two kids. The place itself is beautiful but what really stood out was the guided nature tour they arranged for us in Tarlac. Our guide, Kuya Jun, was super patient with our little ones, even when they kept stopping to look at bugs and plants. He knew so much about the local wildlife and even pointed out a few bird species we’d never seen before. The whole day was relaxed but felt really special. Only thing I’d mention is the trail got a bit muddy after some rain, so maybe wear proper shoes. All in all, a great family outing.</div>
                    <div class="testimonial-author">– Maya Singh, Manila</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Booked a weekend getaway here in April with a group of friends. We did the guided nature tour on Saturday morning—honestly, I didn’t expect to enjoy it as much as I did. Our guide was funny and shared little stories about the area that gave the walk a personal touch. It wasn’t just generic info, you could tell he really grew up around here. We got to see some cool river spots and stopped for snacks that they provided (the local suman was a nice touch). Only reason I’m not giving a full 5 stars is the tour started a bit later than scheduled, but overall, the staff were friendly and the vibe was chill. Would recommend for groups.</div>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Stayed at Aces Resort for my birthday last March and tried their nature tour with my boyfriend. I loved how peaceful the trails were—felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. The guide explained the history of the land, which made it more memorable. We also spotted a family of monkeys in the trees, which I’d never seen in real life before! Ended the walk with fresh coconut juice back at the resort. The whole experience was exactly what I needed to recharge. Thanks to the whole team for making it special.</div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">We highly recommend booking your guided nature tour at least one week in advance, especially during weekends and holidays when demand is high in Tarlac City. This helps us secure your preferred date, ensure guide availability, and arrange any special requests. Last-minute bookings may be possible depending on availability, but advance reservation guarantees the best experience.</div>
